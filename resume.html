            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            
            <h3>Ski Wentworth, Lift Attendant, 2014-2015</h3>

            <div>During my time at Ski Wentworth, I absolutely slayed at guiding the chairlift. I quickly became the only person willing (or dumb enough) to man the T-Bar, AKA The worst mode of uphill transportation known to man.</div>

            <h3> Staples, Sales Woman/Technician, 2015-2019 </h3>
            
            <div>Working at Staples was super cool because I got to work with technology! However, it was also super lame because I had to work with people.</div>

            <h3>Michaels, Cashier/Manager, 2020-2021</h3>
            
            <div>I enjoyed my time at Michaels because the team was excellent. We all worked together very well and got along great. Eventually I became a manager for the holiday season, and I slowly but surely started to loathe the job.</div>

            <h3>Truro Hospital, Housekeeper, 2021-2024</h3>
            
            <div>"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe." ~ Roy Batty, Blade Runner (1982).</div>

            <h2> Schooling </h2>

            <h3>Wentworth Elementary, Preschool to Grade 6</h3>
            
            <div>In case you were curious to know why I'm so awkward and strange, it's because I was raised in the woods deep in the mountains. This school was an extension of my feral upbringing, as it was located in the middle of nowhere. I graduated with only 5 other classmates, and the school itself only had 21 students at its peak.</div>

            <h3>Pugwash District High School, Grade 7 to 12</h3>
            
            <div>There isn't much to say about this place. Pugwash is a funny name, isn't it? Unfortunately, there were no dog grooming courses available at this school. Total scam, honestly.</div>

            <h3>NSCC: Academic Career Connections</h3>
            
            <div>During the pandemic, I decided that I wanted to be a nurse. I took the ACC course to upgrade some of my skills from high school to meet the requirements for nursing school. I then got a job at the Truro Hospital shortly after and realized that I would rather not be a nurse.</div>
